  "VRM dance stage as data — the CLJ/EDN twin of `kami-live` (ADR-0043/0044/0045),
   projected onto the render-IR `kami.webgpu` already consumes.

   A dance stage is a `:dance/*` EDN scene (the same vocabulary `kami_live::scene`
   reads): a tempo grid (`:dance/show`), one-or-more VRM performers (`:dance/avatar`,
   `:dance/cast`), a beat-synced setlist of dance moves (`:dance/setlist`), a static
   stage set (`:dance/stage`), a crowd, lighting and a camera rig (`:dance/camera`).
   Everything is data you fork and diff — a stage *is* a shareable artifact, exactly
   like a kami game.

   This namespace is the pure, cross-platform (`.cljc`) projection: given a scene and a
   wall-clock time `t` (seconds), `frame-ir` returns a render-IR map

     {:globals {:sky {…} :eye [..] :target [..]} :instances [{:pos :color :size :yaw …}]}

   which `kami.webgpu/draw!` (or the WebGL2 path) renders with no GPU-specific code.
   The performer is the same 6-box humanoid the native `dance_png` example poses from a
   `DancePose` (root step + body yaw + vertical bob + arms-up + spine sway); the skinned
   VRM mesh replaces it once the web executor consumes render-IR `:meshes`. The moves are
   faithful ports of `kami_live::performer::DanceMove`, so a stage replays identically on
   web and native given (bpm, t0)."
