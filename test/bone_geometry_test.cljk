  "JVM proofs for the anatomical generators in `kami.webgpu.geometry` — `loft`,
  `long-bone`, `vertebral-body`.

  These need no GPU and no browser, which is the whole reason the generators live
  in this repo rather than in the app that draws them. A bone mesh has four
  properties that are invisible on screen until they are catastrophic:

    closed      every edge borders exactly two triangles, so the solid has no gap
    sound       no triangle has zero area, so no normal is undefined
    oriented    every shared edge is traversed in OPPOSITE directions by its two
                triangles, and the signed volume is positive — together that is
                the exact statement that every face points outward
    shaded      every vertex normal agrees with every face that uses it

  The last one is the one that bit. A shading normal in the opposite hemisphere
  from its own face lights as a hole, and a hole looks like a shader bug rather
  than a geometry bug, so it is looked for in the wrong repo.

  Positions are compared after quantisation because a seam vertex is duplicated
  on purpose (to carry u=0 and u=1 at the same place) and a creased ring is
  duplicated on purpose too; both are the SAME POINT and the topology has to be
  judged on the point, not the index."
