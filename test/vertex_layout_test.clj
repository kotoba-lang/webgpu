  "Gate: the vertex layout is data, and the data still describes the layout the
   executor shipped before it was data.

   Three separate claims, because they fail for different reasons:

   1. **The default layout is unchanged.** The old layout was a literal `#js`
      structure inside `kami.webgpu/vlayout`. Moving it into `kami.webgpu.ir`
      only helps if it moved *without editing* — so the expected strides,
      offsets, formats and shader locations are written out here as the literals
      that were in the executor, not derived from the thing under test.

   2. **The checker rejects what a device would reject, and what a device would
      silently accept.** The second kind matters more: a stride that disagrees
      with the packer's float count is a valid GPU layout that reads the wrong
      bytes per instance.

   3. **The executor's instance ABI and the layout's stride cannot drift.**
      `INST-FLOATS` used to be `32` in the executor beside a bare `128` in the
      layout, with nothing comparing them. This asserts the executor now derives
      it from `kami.webgpu.ir` — a source check, because `kami/webgpu.cljs` is
      .cljs and no JVM test can require it.

   NOT checked here (needs a real WebGPU device): that a custom layout actually
   draws. `vertex-layout-declared-layout-builds-on-real-gpu` in
   playwright_vertex_layout_test.clj does that on hardware."
