  "Gate for the open-world render pipeline table (`kami.pipelines`).

   History: this gate existed to stop the EDN table drifting from its native
   consumer, `kami-engine/kami-render/src/scene_pipelines.rs`. That consumer no
   longer exists — the Rust workspace was removed from kami-engine (the repo now
   declares `:rust-in-default-repo? false` in docs/adapter-registry.edn), so the
   drift branch reads a path that is never present and the whole gate degraded
   into `println \"skip\"` + green.

   A gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate: it reads as coverage. So the
   checks below are ordered by what can actually be verified from here:

     1. structural validity of the table itself — always runs, no co-location
     2. every :shader names a real .wgsl — runs when kami-engine is co-located
     3. Rust drift — runs only if scene_pipelines.rs is somehow back

   and the not-co-located path prints an explicit NOTICE naming which checks did
   not run, instead of a lowercase \"skip\" that scrolls past.

   NOTE (2026-08-04): the table currently has no rendering consumer at all. The
   cljs-direct WebGPU executor (`kami.webgpu`, the ADR-2607120100 standard)
   builds its own pipelines inline in `default-graph` and never requires
   `kami.pipelines`. Every other reference across the fleet is a test, a fixture
   generator, or a docstring pointing at the retired Rust. Six of the eight
   pipelines here (terrain / vegetation / water / voxel / particle / atlas) are
   therefore written, validated, and unreachable. This gate does not assert a
   live consumer exists — that would just fail every run — but it must not imply
   one does either."
