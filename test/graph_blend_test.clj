  "Gate: the executor's :blend vocabulary must equal kami.pipelines' :blend vocabulary.

   `kami.pipelines` is the EDN table describing the open-world pipelines
   (terrain/sky/vegetation/character/water/voxel/particle/atlas) and has carried
   a :blend field — #{:none :alpha} — since it was written. The executor ignored
   it entirely: `blend` appeared nowhere in kami/webgpu.cljs, so every pipeline
   was opaque and the alpha-blended members of that family (water, particle,
   atlas) had nowhere to live. See ADR-2608040400.

   Now that `build-pipeline` reads :blend, the two vocabularies must not drift —
   a graph naming :alpha and a table naming :alpha have to mean the same thing.

   Why this reads source text: kami/webgpu.cljs is .cljs (a GPU executor), so no
   JVM test can require it, and asserting on a real GPUBlendState needs a device.
   Parsing the source is the same technique pipelines_test.clj already uses on
   the native side (kami.pipelines/parse-rust), and it is enough to catch the
   failure this gate exists for: someone adding a mode on one side only.

   NOT checked here (needs a real WebGPU device, no gate on this repo can do it):
   that :alpha actually composites correctly on screen."
