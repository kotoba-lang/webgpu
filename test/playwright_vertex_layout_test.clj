  "The first gate in this repo that drives a REAL WebGPU device.

   Everything else here that touches pipelines either reads source text or runs
   WebGL2 — `graph_blend_test.clj` says so in its own docstring: \"NOT checked
   here (needs a real WebGPU device, no gate on this repo can do it)\". That was
   true of the harness as it stood, for two reasons this namespace fixes:

   1. **The bundled Chromium is not the machine's GPU.** `kami.playwright`
      resolves Playwright's own chromium build, which reports SwiftShader (CPU).
      Launching with `:channel \"chrome\"` gets the installed Chrome and, on this
      machine, Apple M4 / metal-3. A layout that a software rasteriser accepts
      is weaker evidence than one a driver accepts.
   2. **`navigator.gpu` requires a secure context.** `about:blank` — the default
      url of `kami.playwright/eval-page` — has no `navigator.gpu` at all, which
      reads as \"this machine has no WebGPU\" rather than \"wrong origin\". So this
      serves the page from `http://127.0.0.1`, which counts as secure.

   What is proven on hardware:

     - the DEFAULT layout (`kami.webgpu.ir/default-vertex-layout`) is accepted by
       a real driver — 2 buffers, 14 attributes, strides 72/128
     - a CUSTOM layout, structurally unlike the default (strides 8/16), builds a
       pipeline AND draws the instance colour it declares, read back from the
       texture. If a declared layout were ignored in favour of the default, the
       shader's inputs would not be supplied and the pipeline would not build.

   The seam: this test builds the GPU descriptor from the same layout *data* in
   JS, mirroring `kami.webgpu/vertex-buffers`' field mapping (:stride ->
   arrayStride, :step :instance -> stepMode, :format/:offset/:location ->
   format/offset/shaderLocation). It does not execute the .cljs. That mapping is
   pinned separately by `vertex-layout-test/executor-derives-the-instance-abi-from-ir`.

   Skipping: if Chrome or WebGPU is absent this prints a loud SKIP and does not
   fail — but it also asserts the reason is a recognized unavailability, so a
   silent \"0 assertions, all good\" cannot stand in for a run that never happened."
