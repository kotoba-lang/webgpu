  "Gate: every pass list that composites into the HDR target must still run the
   atmosphere pass first.

   This used to assert `(= 2 (count (re-seq …)))` — the number of HDR graphs at
   the time it was written. It went red when a third HDR graph (`:adaptive-post`,
   added by 3d431e3 \"adapt post-processing under entity saturation\") arrived
   *correctly carrying its atmosphere pass*: the count said 3, the test wanted 2.
   A magic number turns \"someone added a graph\" into a failure indistinguishable
   from \"someone dropped the atmosphere\", and because this namespace throws on
   failure it aborted the whole suite behind it.

   So assert the property instead. Adding a fourth HDR graph that keeps its
   atmosphere pass is not a regression and must not read as one; adding one that
   *drops* it must fail here.

   Why this reads source text: kami/webgpu.cljs is .cljs, so no JVM test can
   require it and ask the graphs for their passes — the same constraint
   graph_blend_test.clj documents."
