  "Gate the naga-validity of every kami-render shader generated from kami.render-shaders EDN. The
   render_shader_test gate proves token-equivalence to the shipping native WGSL, but NOT that the WGSL
   is valid — metahuman_skin was a real naga-invalid shipping shader (array<f32,64> in a uniform).
   This naga-checks all 16 from the EDN so an invalid shader can't slip back in. Skips if naga is
   absent (same policy as the co-located gates); CI installs naga so it runs there."
