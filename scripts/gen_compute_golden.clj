;; gen_compute_golden.clj — single-source the cartpole compute-golden (math hash + emitted WGSL)
;; from CLJC data. Phase 3.1 (ADR-2607010930, re-scoped to kami-webgpu).
;;
;; The compute-golden pins two artifacts:
;;   1. fixtures/cartpole-compute-step.wgsl  — the WGSL string `kami.physics-compute/cartpole-step-emit`
;;      produces (the @compute kernel the GPU would run).
;;   2. fixtures/cartpole-compute-golden.json — a fixed input → SHA-256 of the output buffer state,
;;      where the output state is computed by the pure-CLJC mirror in `kami.cartpole-math`.
;;
;; Regenerate both, then assert `git diff --exit-code` is clean — the same "single source, no drift"
;; guarantee `gen_wgsl.clj` gives the lit/shadow shaders. The committed fixtures are what the
;; compute-golden test asserts against, so a divergence in EITHER the emitter OR the math fails
;; its test instead of drifting silently.
;;
;; Run it as:
;;
;;   nbb scripts/run-task.cljs gen-compute-golden     ; == clojure -M:gen-compute-golden
;;
;; The `:gen-compute-golden` alias in deps.edn supplies the two sibling repos this script needs as
;; `:local/root` deps rather than as a hand-written `--classpath` string, because the hand-written
;; one had gone stale in two independent ways and nothing announced it (ADR-2608135000):
;;   * `kami.cartpole-math` was extracted out of this repo into kotoba-lang/cartpole-math, so the
;;     old classpath's `src` no longer resolved it at all — the very first require failed.
;;   * the SDK was extracted out of kotoba-lang/kami-engine into kotoba-lang/kami-engine-sdk (west
;;     path `orgs/kotoba-lang/kami-engine-sdk`), so `../kami-engine/kami-engine-sdk-clj/src` names a
;;     directory that no longer exists.
;; Declaring both as deps means the layout is stated once, in deps.edn, and `clojure` reports a
;; missing sibling itself instead of this script guessing at a path.
