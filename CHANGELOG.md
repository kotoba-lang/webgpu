kami-webgpu — declarative WebGPU + UI/input/audio/state from EDN (hiccup for the GPU).

## Unreleased

### Reuse geometry command streams with WebGPU render bundles (2026-07-16)

World streaming changes instance-buffer contents, but not the pipeline/bind-group/
geometry draw command sequence. The renderer now records one compatible
`GPURenderBundle` per active geometry pipeline and replays it across frames. A
geometry-group signature invalidates the bundle when resident draw counts change;
instance-buffer growth clears all bundles because it replaces the GPU buffer handle.
Backend frame evidence reports `:render-bundle-count` for deterministic browser gates.

Royale's fixed-frame Chromium SwiftShader gate at 639 submitted instances recorded
two bundles, one queue submit per frame, no GPU validation errors, and no device loss.
The measured median remained 73.6 ms (p95 76.0 ms), so this removes JS command-recording
work but does not pretend to close the software-GPU raster wall or the 16.7 ms hardware
target. A tested half-resolution-HDR alternative regressed to 75.2 ms and was rejected.

### `draw!` caches per-frame instance-buffer work for a static scene (2026-07-10)

Found via `com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2607100100's M4 investigation: a real-browser
benchmark (`kami-app-amenominaka`, Playwright + full Chromium, static scene, 60 frames)
showed `draw!`'s frame time scaling with instance count even when nothing in the scene
changed between frames — 15,000 instances cost ~34ms/frame (≈29fps). Reading the code
found why: every `draw!` call unconditionally re-sorted `:instances` by geometry kind,
re-grouped them, re-marshaled the packed model-matrix+color+material `Float32Array`, and
re-uploaded it to the GPU via `write-buffer!` — even for a scene composed once and drawn
every `requestAnimationFrame` with the exact same value, the overwhelmingly common usage
pattern.

`init!`'s returned context now carries an `:instance-cache` atom; `draw!` factors that
sort/group/centroid/marshal work into a new pure `compute-instance-data`, keyed on
`(:instances ir)` by **reference** (`identical?`, not `=` — cheap, and correct for the
common "compose once, draw every frame" pattern; a caller that rebuilds an equal-but-
not-identical instances vector every frame just won't hit the cache, not a correctness
issue) and skips the GPU `write-buffer!` entirely on a cache hit.

Backward compatible: a caller that builds a context map without going through `init!`
(no `:instance-cache` key) just always takes the cache-miss path — same behavior as
before, no crash (`some->` guards every cache read/write).

Measured improvement (same benchmark, same machine, before → after): 5,000 instances
11.4ms→0.47ms/frame; 15,000 instances 34.0ms→0.85ms/frame; 20,000 instances (capped at
`MAX-INST` 16,384) 36.3ms→1.03ms/frame — roughly a 30-40× reduction in per-frame cost at
the high end, confirmed by re-running the existing `kami-app-amenominaka` M2 real-browser
smoke test (`test/render/verify_m2_render.cljs`) unchanged and getting the identical
correct screenshot. `bb test`'s existing `.cljc` suite (unaffected — this change is
`.cljs`-only) stays green throughout.

Note this closes the *actual* wall ADR-2607100100 M4 investigated — a redundant re-upload,
not a GPU rendering-capacity limit. `wgsl` `@compute`-based GPU-side instance generation
(the ADR's original speculative M4 direction) was not pursued since it wouldn't have
addressed this specific, now-measured bottleneck; it remains available as future work if a
*different* real wall is found later (e.g. from the still-unaddressed `MAX-INST` 16,384
hard cap silently truncating larger scenes — a correctness gap, not a performance one,
flagged separately).

### Dedup pass across kotoba-lang/{sprite-gpu,gpu,webgl} (2026-07-09)

Three standalone repos (`kotoba-lang/sprite-gpu`, `kotoba-lang/gpu`, `kotoba-lang/webgl`) each
carried a duplicate of a namespace that also lives here (`kami.sprite-gpu`, `kami.gpu`,
`kami.webgl`), left over from the abandoned "clj-wgsl Phase-4" split-migration + independent
"restore" commits (2026-07-02). All three pairs were diffed in detail rather than assumed:

- **`sprite-gpu`** — `kami.sprite-gpu` (here) wins. It has the `:rect` half-extent bug fix (PR #10,
  above) that the standalone repo's copy never received; the standalone repo's own git history has
  no commits beyond CI/lint housekeeping since its restore. `kotoba-lang/sprite-gpu`'s
  `kotoba.sprite-gpu` is now a thin re-export of this namespace.
- **`gpu`** — `kami.gpu` (here) wins, though the diff is docstring-only (no functional bug on
  either side — every `def`/`defn` body was byte-identical). `kami.gpu` reflects the more current
  "capability-gated render-graph contract" doc pass; the standalone repo received no comparable
  work. `kotoba-lang/gpu`'s `kotoba.gpu` is now a thin re-export of this namespace.
- **`webgl` — the SURPRISING one: the standalone repo was more current here, not this repo.**
  `kotoba-lang/webgl`'s `kotoba.webgl` was already `.cljc` with a `#?(:clj ...)` fallback branch
  (JVM-safe capability queries + explicit "browser-only executor" errors instead of blowing up on
  `js/navigator`), backed by its own JVM test (`webgl-test`). `kami.webgl` here was plain `.cljs`
  with none of that — a real feature gap, not just docs. So instead of repointing consumers away
  from the standalone repo's content, **that `.cljc` structure was ported INTO this repo**:
  `src/kami/webgl.cljs` → `src/kami/webgl.cljc` (adds the `:clj` branch, verbatim-ported from
  `kotoba.webgl`'s), `src/kami/webgl/glsl.cljs` → `src/kami/webgl/glsl.cljc` (pure data, no
  reader-conditional needed — its content was already byte-identical between the two repos), and a
  new `test/webgl_test.clj` (ported from the standalone repo's) wired into `bb test`, giving
  `kami.webgl` JVM coverage it never had. This also matches this repo's own stated design
  philosophy ("A `.cljc`-first library", per `deps.edn`'s header comment). `kotoba-lang/webgl`'s
  `kotoba.webgl` is now, in turn, a thin re-export of this (now at-parity) namespace.

Consumers: `network-isekai`, `net-babiniku`, and everything else already depending on this repo are
unaffected (same public API, same behaviour, `kami.webgl` gained functionality rather than losing
any). `kotoba-lang/scene2d` and `kotoba-lang/webgl` (the repo, for its own internal use before this
change) have been repointed from the standalone `sprite-gpu`/`gpu` repos to depend on this repo
directly. See each affected repo's own README/CHANGELOG for its side of this.

### Renderer (`kami.webgpu`)
- Declarative WebGPU from a pure EDN render-IR — CLJS drives the browser WebGPU API directly
  (no Rust, no wasm, no per-frame string marshaling).
- Render graph as data: shaders, offscreen targets, samplers, pipelines, and an ordered
  `:passes` array are all EDN; the executor interprets them (reorder/add passes by editing data).
- Real shadows: a sun shadow-map pass + PCF sampling, expressed as the first `:passes` entry.
- PBR materials as per-instance EDN (metallic / roughness / emissive).
- Known footgun fixed: GPU buffers written with `writeBuffer` need `COPY_DST`, or the write
  silently no-ops and the buffer reads as zeros (the original "clear works, no geometry" bug).

### Data-driven domains (each EDN, ADR-0040)
- `kami.ui` — HUD as EDN → DOM overlay (`:panel` / `:bar` / `:text` / `:minimap`).
- `kami.input` — key/pointer bindings → axes & actions, as data.
- `kami.audio` — sound cues as EDN recipes, synthesized via Web Audio.
- `kami.fsm` — animation/behaviour state machines as data.
- `kami.physics` — collision layers + matrix as data; `separate` resolves overlaps.
- `kami.netsync` — replication schema (what syncs) as data; `snapshot` / `apply-snapshot` / `interp`.
- `kami.level` — spawns + shrinking zone (storm) + objective as data.
- `kami.webgpu.ir` — render-IR shape + a camera rig (`rig->camera`), cross-platform `.cljc`.

### Cross-platform (ADR-0042)
- The `.cljc` interpreters are the same source the web (CLJS), native (kotoba-clj→WASM, via
  kami-script-runtime), and JVM (babashka) all run. Verified determinism: the native scatter RNG
  matches the web's xorshift sequence — same EDN → same world.

### Tests
- `bb test` — the `.cljc` interpreters on the JVM (examples + properties; 8 tests / 42 assertions).
- `bb verify` / superproject `scripts/verify-clj-everywhere.sh` — all surfaces in one command
  (JVM + native WASM + native renderer).
- CI: GitHub Actions runs `bb test` on every push.
- Bug found via coverage work and fixed upstream: kotoba-clj `into` overflowed when the dst was
  at exact capacity (a vector literal); now returns a correctly-sized new vector.
- **Bug fixed: `kami.sprite-gpu/prim->quad`'s `:rect` case doubled the rendered width/height.**
  A prior agent (kotoba-lang/kami-isekai-assets PR #4) found this while validating a Canvas2D
  probe against the GPU path but left the fix to this repo. `:w`/`:h` are FULL width/height in
  the sprite2d vocabulary (`kami.sprite2d.cljs`'s reference `:rect` painter draws
  `fillRect(dx-w/2, dy-h/2, w, h)`), but `prim->quad` was passing them straight into `:size`,
  which the sprite-SDF vertex shader consumes as a HALF-extent (quad corners ±1 scaled by
  `:size`) — a `[:rect {:w 100 :h 50}]` rendered at ~200×100px instead of ~100×50px. Fixed by
  halving `:w`/`:h` in `prim->quad`; `:r`/`:rx`/`:ry` (circle/ellipse/arc) were already radii
  (= half-extents) and needed no change. New pixel-verified regression test
  (`test/playwright_rect_extent_test.clj`, wired into `bb render-test`) renders the probe in a
  real headless WebGL2 browser and measures its on-screen bounding box; confirmed it fails
  against the pre-fix code (measured ~200×100px) and passes against the fix (~100×50px).
  Investigated before fixing: no scene in this repo or in `gftdcojp/network-isekai`'s
  `public/games/*/scene.edn` (26 of 31 use `:rect`) currently renders through this GPU path —
  every one of those scenes uses `:render/sprite2d` (the correct Canvas2D painter); the
  GPU/instanced path (`:render/gpu2d`) exists in `network-isekai`'s `isekai/game.cljc` but no
  scene opts into it. `kotoba-lang/kami-isekai-assets`'s render-adapter does feed this path, but
  its own render_pixel_test.clj only exercises `:ellipse`/`:circle` primitives (the slime
  preset), not `:rect`. So no shipped/tested content depended on the buggy half-extent
  behaviour — the fix is a straight correctness fix, not a breaking behaviour change to any
  live consumer.
